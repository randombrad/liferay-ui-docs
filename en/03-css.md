# CSS
The second component of a web page is the presentation information contained in the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). Web browsers successful implementation of CSS has given a whole generation of web authors site-wide control over the look and feel of their web sites.

Just as the information on a web page is semantically described in the HTML Markup, CSS describes all presentation aspects of the page via a description of it's visual properties. CSS is powerful in that these properties are mixed and matched via identifiers to control the page's layout and visual characteristics through the layering of style rules (the "cascade").

## Font-Weight
Use font-weight values (100-900) instead of name such as normal, bold, bolder. <a href="//www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/fonts.html#font-boldness">- W3 -</a></p>
There can be confusion how to render the text based font-weight values

* 100 Thin, Hairline, Ultra-light, Extra-light
* 200 Light
* 300 Book
* 400 Regular, Normal, Plain, Roman, Standard
* 500 Medium
* 600 Semi-bold, Demi-bold
* 700 Bold
* 800 Heavy, Black, Extra-bold
* 900 Ultra-black, Extra-black, Ultra-bold, Heavy-black, Fat, Poster
