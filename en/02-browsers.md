# Browsers

Not all features will look great in all browsers, but we go by the principle "degrade gracefully", meaning that the functionality of the site is still in tact. For example CSS3 rounded borders won't display rounded in IE 6.

* IE 6 :(
* IE 7
* IE 8
* FF 3.6
* FF 4
* FF 5
* Chrome
* Safari
* Opera

## IE6
.png files that have transparency don't display correctly. In Liferay you can add the class of "png" to the element that has the transparent image and it may fix the problem, but use this method sparingly.
